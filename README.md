# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project is a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset. It’s divided into three main parts, guiding through each step in working with the data—from getting to know it, preparing it, and finally making predictions on survival outcomes. This README gives a quick overview and simple instructions to help run the code smoothly.

## Getting Started

The code is designed to be run on `Google Colab` or `Jupyter Notebook`. To execute it, simply run all cells in sequence, starting from the top. Ensure the correct file paths for the training and test datasets are inserted before running the code.

## Project Structure

The code is divided into three main sections:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understands the data’s structure, distributions, and relationships.

**Feature Engineering:** Prepares the data for predictive modeling by creating, transforming, or scaling features as needed.

**Prediction:** Applies classification algorithms to predict survival outcomes. This includes models such as:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost

## Instructions

1. Ensure that paths to the train and test datasets are correctly specified.

```
data=pd.read_csv('/path/to/train.csv')
data.head()
```

2. Run All Cells: Begin from the top and run each code cell in sequence. This will perform EDA, apply feature engineering, and generate predictions.
   
3. Review Outputs: Outputs and model evaluations are available after each section.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`
