# Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset. The code is organized into three main parts, each covering a specific aspect of the data journey, from understanding it to making predictions. This README provides a quick overview and instructions to help you get started.

## Getting Started

The code is designed to be run on `Google Colab` or `Jupyter Notebook`. To execute it, simply run all cells in sequence, starting from the top. Ensure the correct file paths for the training and test datasets are inserted before running the code.

## Project Structure

The code is divided into three main sections:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understands the dataâ€™s structure, distributions, and relationships.

**Feature Engineering:** Prepares the data for predictive modeling by creating, transforming, or scaling features as needed.

**Prediction:** Applies classification algorithms to predict survival outcomes. This includes models such as:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost

## Instructions

1. Ensure that paths to the train and test datasets are correctly specified.

```
data=pd.read_csv('/path/to/train.csv')
data.head()
```

2. Run All Cells: Begin from the top and run each code cell in sequence. This will perform EDA, apply feature engineering, and generate predictions.
   
3. Review Outputs: Outputs and model evaluations are available after each section.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`
